# Lambda-Project

**Usage**: 

Searching for class recordings and notes has always been a pain in the neck and a time-waste. With this website, one can easily access all the recordings and notes of their classes/clubs all stored in one place. 
The page has been divided into three sections: Academics, Sci-Tech. Cultural. Each division is furthermore segregated into categories depending on the branches or clubs.

**Working**: 

One just has to navigate to the section they need recordings or notes for and click on the cards that appear. They will be redirected to a page where all the links will be provided.

**Specifics**: 

The languages used are CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Library and Framework include AOS and Bootstrap.
